Title:
Hotel Booking Cancellation EDA

Overview:
This project involves an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of hotel booking cancellations, focusing on City Hotel and Resort Hotel. The objective is to understand the factors influencing high cancellation rates and provide actionable insights to mitigate these cancellations and enhance revenue generation.

Problem Statement:
City Hotel and Resort Hotel have been experiencing high cancellation rates, leading to reduced revenues and suboptimal room utilization. The primary goal is to reduce these cancellation rates to improve the efficiency of revenue generation and provide comprehensive business recommendations to address this issue.

Data Cleaning:
The dataset underwent a thorough cleaning process, including:

Removing null values.
Dropping unnecessary columns.
Removing outliers from the Average Daily Rate (ADR) column.

Research Questions:
1. What are the variables that affect hotel reservation cancellations?
2. How can we reduce hotel reservation cancellations?
3. How can hotels make informed pricing and promotional decisions?
4. How does the cancellation rate vary among different customer types?
5. How does the cancellation rate vary with the duration of stay?

Hypothesis:
1. More cancellations occur when prices are higher.
2. Customers tend to cancel more frequently when there is a longer waiting list.
3. The majority of clients use offline travel agents for their reservations.
4. Transient customers have higher cancellation rates.
5. Customers planning longer stays are less likely to cancel their reservations.

conclusions: 

City Hotels have a higher number of reservations (both canceled and not canceled) compared to Resort Hotels.

City Hotels have a higher cancellation rate (41%) than Resort Hotels (27%).

ADR trends for Resort Hotels show higher volatility and significant seasonal spikes compared to the more stable ADR trends of City Hotels.

Cancellations are most common in January and least common in August.

Higher prices correlate with increased cancellations, indicating that cost sensitivity is a major factor.

47% of clients book through Online Travel Agencies, 20% through Offline Travel Agencies, 16% from groups, and only 10% book directly.

ADR for canceled bookings is consistently higher than for non-canceled bookings, suggesting higher ADRs may lead to more cancellations.

Transient customers have the highest cancellation rate, followed by Contract and Transient-Party customers, while Group customers have the lowest.
Longer bookings are more prone to cancellations, likely due to changing travel plans or higher costs associated with extended stays.

suggestions:
Based on the analysis, the following suggestions are proposed to reduce cancellation rates:

In order to prevent cancelation of reservations, Hotels could work on their pricing strategies and try to lower the rates for specific hotels based on locations or provide some discounts to the clients.

As the ratio of the canceled and not canceled of the resort hotels is higher than that of city hotels. so the hotels should provide a reasonable discount on the room prices on weekends or holidays.

As the cancellations are higher in the month of January, the hotels can start campaigns or marketings with reasonable amount to increase their revenue.

Quality of hotels and their services can be increased mainly in portugal to reduce cancellation.

Enhance the booking experience on Online Travel Agency platforms to reduce cancellations from the major customer segment.

Consider price adjustments or special offers during high ADR periods to reduce cancellations.
Provide discounts for extended stays to mitigate higher costs.
